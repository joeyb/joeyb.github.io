title: "Is Attention to Detail Teachable?"
tags: [programming]
---

It has been my experience that the single largest factor in determining the talent level and/or
potential of a software developer is attention to detail. Regardless of tools and technologies used,
sweating the small stuff is critical to delivering a successful product that is built to last and
not just rushed out the door. To me the biggest difference between a Mid-level and Senior Developer
is the discipline to maintain that level of thoroughness without over-engineering solutions and
blowing deadlines.

I have met several developers who are very knowledgable, understand the technologies they are using,
and produce code that functions but have little concern for simple details like: consistent
whitespace, naming conventions, and following [SOLID principles][1]. I agree that functioning code
is priority number 1, but if the product you are building is not intended to be an MVP or an early
stage R&D project then it is likely that more time will end up being spent reading your code than
was spent writing it.

Given a developer in that situation, how do you teach them attention to detail? There is an
interesting [Programmers Stack Exchange question][2] about learning how to pay more attention to
detail, but I have found little advice around the web on how to teach that skill and why it is truly
important to someone else. I think the problem is that it requires foresight and it is difficult to
immediately show demonstrable benefits. I would love to hear stories of methods used to help teach an
otherwise talented developer the importance and value of really paying attention to detail.
